I've been run down, I've been lied to
I don't know why I let that mean woman make me out a fool
She took all my money, wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinkin' in some cross town bar
Sometimes I feel, oh, Lord, sometimes
Like I've been tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post, tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'
My friends tell, that I've been such a fool
And I have to stand back, take it babe, all for lovin' you
I drown myself in sorrow, as I look at what you've done
But nothin' seems to change, the bad times stay the same
And I can't run
Sometimes I feel, sometimes
I've been tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post, tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'
Sometimes I feel, sometimes, yeah
I've been tied, oh, it's another bad day, oh, she [Incomprehensible]
Oh, Lord, good Lord, what a feeling, what a feeling
Oh, feel like I'm dyin', yeah
