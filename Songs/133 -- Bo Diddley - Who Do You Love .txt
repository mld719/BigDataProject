I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a walk with me Arlene
And tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tombstone hand
And a graveyard mine
Just 22
And I don't mind dying
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I rode around the town
Use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene
Don't give me no lip
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Night was dark but the sky was blue
Down the alley, ice-wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should have heard just what I've seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Arlene took me
By my hand
And she said, "Ooowee bo
You know I understand"
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
