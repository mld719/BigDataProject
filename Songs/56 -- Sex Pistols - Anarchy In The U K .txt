Right now
I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
I know what I want and
I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passerby
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city
Anarchy for the UK
It's coming sometime maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city, the only way to be
How many ways
To get what you want?
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy, I use anarchy
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city, follow me
Is this the MPLA?
Or is this the UDA?
Or is this the IRA
I thought it was the UK
Or just another country
Another council tenancy
And I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Get pissed destroy
