Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion
And I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
Ooo ooo ooo whoa
