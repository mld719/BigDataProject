Well, I wish, I was a catfish
Swimmin' in a oh, deep blue sea
I would have all you good lookin' women
Fishin', fishin' after me
Sure 'nough, after me
Sure 'nough, after me
Oh 'nough, oh 'nough, sure 'nough
I went to my baby's house
And I sit down oh, on her steps
She said, "Now, come on in now, Muddy"
You know, my husband just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left
Sure 'nough, oh well, oh well
Well, my mother told my father
Just before hmm, I was born
"I got a boy child's comin'
He's gonna be, he's gonna be a "Rollin' Stone"
Sure 'nough, he's a "Rollin' Stone"
Sure 'nough, he's a "Rollin' Stone"
Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a
Well, I feel, yes I feel
Feel that I could lay down oh, time ain't long
I'm gonna catch the first thing smokin'
Back, back down the road I'm goin'
Back down the road I'm goin'
Back down the road I'm goin'
Sure 'nough back, sure 'nough back
