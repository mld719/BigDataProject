Well, we can't take it this week
And her friends don't want another speech
Hoping for a better day to hear what she's got to say
All about that, personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got
That's why they talk about personality
But now your tryin' to be some, now you got to do some
Wanna be someone who cow wow wows
But you thinkin' about the times you did, they took every ounce
When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you were butterflyin' about
You was butterflyin'
About that personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hard to know when frustration and heartache what you got
I'm sorta talkin' 'bout personality, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
And you're a prima ballerina on a spring afternoon
Change on into the wolfman howlin' at the moon, ooh
Got a personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hard to know when frustration and heartache what you got
Now with all the crossin' fingers Mother Nature says
Your mirror's gettin' jammed up with all your friends
That personality everything starts to blend, [Incomprehensible]
Personality when your mind starts to blend, talk about
Personality impression of a friend
Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend
Personality wonderin' how celebrities ever met
Look and find out on television
Personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hard to know when frustration, heartache is all you've got
Oh, don't you worry, personality crisis, please don't cry
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop
Because you walk a personality, talk a personality
