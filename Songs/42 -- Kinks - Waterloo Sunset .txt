Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze at
Waterloo sunset
I am in Paradise
Every day I look at the world
From my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine
Terry meets July
Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I'm so lazy don't want to wander
I stay at home with dad
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze at
Waterloo sunset
I am in Paradise
Waterloo sunset's fine
