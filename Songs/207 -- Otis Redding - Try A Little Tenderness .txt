Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old Shaggy dress, yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah
You know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never, never, never, never possess
Yeah, yeah
But while she there waiting
Without them try a little tenderness
Thats all you got to do
It's not just sentimental no, no, no
She has her greavs and care, yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah
You won't regret it no, no
Young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness, yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
You got to do is try
Try a little tenderness
Yeah
All you got to do is [Incomprehensible]
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her got got got to try a little tenderness
