Part two, it's so crazy right now
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing, no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing, no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
It's so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love's, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Young Ho, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R O C, uh oh
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only
Stick bony but the pocket is fat like Tony, Soprano
The ROC handle like Van Axel
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to
The genuine article I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, roll like green Corvette
Crazy bring ya whole set
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure them out they like, hey is he insane
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young
Ever since the label changed over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
To platinum the game's been wrap, one
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me
So crazy baby
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
It's so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
