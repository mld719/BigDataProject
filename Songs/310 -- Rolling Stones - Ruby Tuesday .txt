She would never say where she came from
And yesterday don't matter if it's gone
And while the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night no one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
And she just can't be chained
To a life where nothings gained and nothings lost
At such a cost
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
If you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Go catch your dreams before they slip away
And dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?
And goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
And goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
