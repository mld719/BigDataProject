Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

She's the queen of all the teens
She's the one that I know
She's the one that loves me so
Say, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

Well she's the one that got that beat
She's the one with the flyin' feet
She's the one that walks around the store
She's the one that gets more, more, more, more
Say, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby love
My baby love, my baby love
Yes my, here now
Well, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby love
My baby love, my baby love
