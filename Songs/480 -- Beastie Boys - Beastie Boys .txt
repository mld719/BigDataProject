Ah, BEASTIE go
BEASTIE
That's just what Beasties gotta' be
Can't you see this is an emergency
Can you feel the urgency
BEASTIE
BEASTIE
Withhold of democracy
In a state of emergency now
Ah, going out to rock the state
Let's just come and take unique
All across the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
BEASTIE
BEASTIE
Captain stayed off so merrily
In a state of emergency now
Ah, BEASTIE
Cops just don't give respect to me
World is filled with tyranny
All across the stormy sea
BEASTIE
BEASTIE
Who the hell are we off to see?
Let's just come and take unique
Now BEASTIE go
BEASTIE go
