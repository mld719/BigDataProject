We were at a party
His ear lobe fell in the deep
Someone reached in and grabbed it
It was a rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
We were at the beach
Everybody had matching towels
Somebody went under a dock
And there they saw a rock
It wasn't a rock
It was a rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Motion in the ocean
His air hose broke
Lots of trouble
Lots of bubble
He was in a jam
He's in a giant clam
Rock, rock
Rock lobster
Down, down
Underneath the waves
Mermaids wavin'
Wavin' to mermen
Wavin' sea fans
Sea horses sailin'
Dolphins wailin'
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Red snappers snappin'
Clam shells clappin'
Mussels flexin'
Flippers flippin'
Rock, rock
Rock lobster
Down, down
Lobster
Rock lobster
Rock
Let's rock
Boys in bikinis
Girls in surfboards
Everybody's rockin'
Everybody's fruggin'
Twistin' 'round the fire
Havin' fun
Bakin' potatoes
Bakin' in the sun
Put on your nose guard
Put on the lifeguard
Pass the tannin' butter
Here comes a stringray
There goes a manta ray
In walked a jelly fish
There goes a dogfish
Chased by a catfish
In flew a sea robin
Watch out for that piranha
There goes a narwhal
Here comes a bikini whale
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
Rock lobster
