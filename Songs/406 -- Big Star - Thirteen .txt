Won't you let me walk you home from the school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you
Won't you tell your dad, "Get off my back?"
Tell him what we said about 'Paint it, black'
Rock n' roll is here to stay come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well, let me know, if it's no, well I can go
I won't make you
