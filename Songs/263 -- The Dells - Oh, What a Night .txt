Do you recall the night, that very very special night
Do you remember a girl, that very special girl
Well to the old and to the new
We rededicate this song to you
Oh, what a night to love you dear
Oh, what a night to hold you near
Oh, what a night to squeeze you dear
That's why I love you so
Oh, what a night to love you dear
Oh, what a night to want you dear
Oh, what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you so
I won't forget all those things
You have told to me
The craze in my heart
Won't let me forget your love
Oh, what a night to love you dear
Oh, what a night to want you dear
Oh what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you so
Oh, what a night to love you dear
Oh, what a night to want you dear
Oh what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you so
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
One more night, I wanna hold you one more night
I wanna make love to you one more night
I want you baby, I want you baby
I need you baby, I love you baby
One more night
