Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can hear your mama call
From the early, early morning
Till the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly, Miss Molly's
Rocking at the House of Blue Lights
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can hear your mama call
Momma, pappa told me
"Son, you better watch your step
If I knew my momma, pappa
Have to watch my pappa myself"
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can hear your mama call
Good Golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can hear your mama call
I am going to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me
Kiss me ting-a-ling-a-ling
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can hear your mama call
