Bo, bo
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
There she goes
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
There she goes
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
Bo, bo
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
Bo, bo
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where she is bound
I broke her heart and made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do?
There goes my baby
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
There goes my baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There goes my baby
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
There she goes
(Yeah)
I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?
I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me so all alone
So all alone
I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side to be my guide
I wanna know where is my
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
Where is my baby
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
I want my baby
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
I need my baby, yeah
(Doo doot, doo doo, doo, doo)
(Whoa, oh, oh)
There goes my baby
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
There goes my baby
