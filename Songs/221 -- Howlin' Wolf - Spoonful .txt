It could fill spoon full of diamond
Could fill spoon full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul
Men lies about them
Some of them cries about them
Some of them dies about them
Everything a fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
It could fill spoon full of coffee
Could fill spoon full of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Could had enough for me
Men lies about them
Some of them dies about them
Some of them cries about them
But everything fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that
Fightin' 'bout a spoonful
Fightin' 'bout a spoonful
It could fill spoon full of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of little forty-five
Save you from another man
Men lies about them
Some of them cries about them
Some of them dies about them
Everybody fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that
