She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, is crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cos I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart
And I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standin' in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts
Now I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
Free fallin', now I'm, free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm, free fallin', now I'm
I wanna glide down over Valhalla
I wanna write her name in the sky
Gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while
Now I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin' oh
Free falling
Yeah I'm free, oh free fallin'
