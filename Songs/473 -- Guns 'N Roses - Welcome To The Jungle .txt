Welcome to the jungle, we got fun 'n' games
We got everything you want, honey we know the names
We are the people that you find, whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey we got your disease
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your kn-kn-knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl whose very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get them for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream
Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want but you better not take it from me
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your kn-kn-knees, knees
I'm gonna watch you bleed
And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, sucked down, so down, yeah
You know where you are, you're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your kn-kn-knees, knees
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your kn-kn-knees, knees
Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down, huh
