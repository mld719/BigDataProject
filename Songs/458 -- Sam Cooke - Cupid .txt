Cupid draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
Cupid please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now I don't mean to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix
So Cupid draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid if your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So Cupid draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid don't you hear me
Callin' you, I need you
