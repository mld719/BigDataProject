Oh yeah, but oh yeah, oh yeah, alright
Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Well, the oppressors are tryin' to keep me down
Tryin' to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done
'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Oh yeah yeah, well, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Then living as a puppet or a slave
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share right now, what's mine
And then the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all
