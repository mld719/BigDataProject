I hear the train a comin' it's rollin 'round the bend
And I a'int seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a movin' on down to-San-An-Tone
When I was just a baby my mame told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I heat the whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry
Well, if they freed me fom this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Far from Fulsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonsome whistle, blow my blues away
I don't like it
But I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along I guess I will, some way
I don't like it But I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
Then He put me on my own Heaven help me be a man
Have the strength to stand aloneI don't like it
But I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll find another
I don't know
I can't say I don't like it But I guess things happen that way
