Cynthia get up and dance to the music!
Get on up and dance to the music!
Dance to the music, dance to the music
Dance to the music, dance to the music
Hey Greg!
What?
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat yeah
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet
I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
I said him, "Ride Sally ride now"
Cynthia get up on
If I could hear the horns blowin'
Cynthia on the throne, yeah!
Listen to me
Cynthia and Jerry got a message they're sayin'
"All the squares, go home!"
Listen to the voices
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
...
