Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't country at all
Raving station, beside yourself
Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the hull
That this isn't nothing at all
Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio
Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fortunate at all
Raving station, beside yourself
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio
Decide yourself, calling all of the media's too fast
Keep me out of country in the word
Disappoint is into us absurd
Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio free Europe
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio free Europe
