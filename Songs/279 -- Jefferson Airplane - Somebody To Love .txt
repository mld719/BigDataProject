When the truth is found to be lies
An' all the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find someone to love, love
When the dawn is rose they are dead
Yes, and you're mine, you're mine, you're so full of red
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find someone to love
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah, but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find someone to love
Tears are runnin', runnin' along down your breast
And your friends, baby, they treat you like a guest
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find someone to love
