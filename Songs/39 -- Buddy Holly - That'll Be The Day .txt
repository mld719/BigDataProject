Well that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah, yes that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, you gave me all your loving
And all your turtle doving
All your hugs and kisses
And your money too, well
You know you love me, baby
Still you tell me maybe
That somebody, well
I'll be through
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah, yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah, yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, when cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we'll ever part
And I'll leave you
You say and hold me
And you tell me boldly
That some day well
I'll be through
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah, yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, that'll be the day
Well, that'll be the day
Well, that'll be the day
Well, that'll be the day
