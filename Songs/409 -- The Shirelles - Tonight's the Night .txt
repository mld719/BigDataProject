You said you're gonna meet me
Tonight's the night
You said you're gonna kiss me
Tonight's the night
Well, I don't know
Said, "I don't know right now"
I might love you so
You say you're gonna beg me
Turn the lights down low
You said you're gonna make me
Feel all aglow
Well, I don't know
Well, I don't know right now
I might love you so
I might love you so much
You may break my heart
I may want you so much
And all my dream been torn apart
You say you're gonna love me
Tonight's the night
You say you're gonna hold me
Tonight's the night, I don't know
Said, "I don't know right now"
I might love you so
Let's take a chance
Gonna be a great romance
Movin' right now
Gonna be a great romance
Gonna be a great romance
Gonna be a great romance
...
