Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line
Rags to riches or so they say
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capitol crime, everybody' doin' their time

And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah
Take me down to the paradise city

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me that you're gonna believe
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losing my mind, are you blind? I've seen it all a million times
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
