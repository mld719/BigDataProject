When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
Only doll I’ve ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown
It gets stronger in every way
It gets deeper, let me say
It gets higher day by day
Do I love you my, oh, my?
As river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby?
Oh, when you were a young boy, did you have a puppy?
Always followed you around
Well, I’m gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I’ll never let you down
It goes on and on like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and Heaven knows
It gets sweeter baby, as it grows
Do I love you my, oh, my?
Like river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby?
I love you baby, like a flower loves the spring
And I love you honey, oh, like a robin loves to sing
Oh, I love you babe, like a schoolboy loves his bag
And I love you honey, river deep, mountain high
Baby, baby
Do I love you my, oh, my?
I said, as river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby?
