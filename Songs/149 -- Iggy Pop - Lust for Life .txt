Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs and the flesh machine
He’s gonna do another strip tease
Hey man, where'd you get that lotion?
I’ve been hurting since I’ve bought the gimmick
Something called love, yeah, something called love
Well, that’s like hypnotizing chickens
Well, I’m just a modern guy
Of course, I’ve had it in the ear before
Well, I’ve a lust for life ’cause I’ve a lust for life
I’m worth a million in prizes with my torture film
Drive a GTO, wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I’m worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I’m through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
And no more beating my brains
With liquor and drugs, with liquor and drugs
Well, I’m just a modern guy
Of course, I’ve had it in my ear before
Well, I’ve a lust for life, ’cause I've a lust for life
I got a lust for life, got a lust for life
Oh, a lust for life, oh, a lust for life
A lust for life, I got a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Well, I’m just a modern guy
Of course, I’ve had it in my ear before
Well, I’ve a lust for life ’cause I’ve a lust for life
Oh well, here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs and the flesh machine
I know he’s gonna do another strip tease
Hey man, where’d you get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love, oh, love, love, love
Well, that’s like hypnotizing chickens
Well, I’m just a modern guy
Of course, I’ve had it in the ear before
And I’ve a lust for life ’cause I’ve a lust for life
Got a lust for life, yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life, oh, lust for life
Got a lust for life, yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life, lust for life
Lust for life, lust for life, a lust for life, lust for life
