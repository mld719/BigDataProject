She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene.
I said I don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor in the round.
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
Then every head turned with eyes of being the one.
Who will dance on the floor in the round.
People always told me be careful of what you do.
Don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
And mother always told me, be careful of who you love.
And be careful of what you do, because a lie becomes a truth.
Billie Jean is not my lover,
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one,
But the kid is not my son.
She says I am the one,
But the kid is not my son.
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side.
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans.
Do a dance on the floor in the round.
So take my strong advice.
Just remember to always think twice.
Do think twice! Do think twice!
She told my baby we'd dance 'till three, then she looked at me.
Then show a photo, my baby cried, his eyes were like mine.
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby.
People always told me be careful of what you do.
Don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me.
And the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon, she called me to her room.
Billie Jean is not my lover,
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one,
But the kid is not my son.
She says I am the one,
But the kid is not my son.
