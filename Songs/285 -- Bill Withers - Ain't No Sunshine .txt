Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She always gone too long anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
This house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
I know
I know
I know
Hey, I oughta leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know
I know
I know
Hey, I oughta leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
