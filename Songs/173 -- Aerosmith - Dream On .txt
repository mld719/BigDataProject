Yeah
Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer, the past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn, Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Well I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in book's written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things you do, come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, I'm just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, I'm just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Listen, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until the dream come true
Yea, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your body getting blue
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, oh
Sing, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Sing, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
