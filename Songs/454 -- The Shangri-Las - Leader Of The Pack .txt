Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is, let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing? Uhm, hmm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today? Uhm, umm
By the way, where'd you meet him?
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture? Yes, we see
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack
My folks were always putting him down
(Down, down)
They said, he came from the wrong side of town
(What you mean when you say that he came
From the wrong side of town?)
They told me, he was bad, but I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack
One day my dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy, we're through
(What you mean when you say that
You better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why, all I could do was cry
I'm sorry, I hurt you, the leader of the pack
He sort of smiled and kissed me good-bye
The tears were beginnin' to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard, I'll never know
Look out, look out
Look out, look out
I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Rememberin' all the things we'd been through
At school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)
The leader of the pack, now he's gone
(Gone)
The leader of the pack, now he's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)
The leader of the pack, now he's gone
(Gone)
The leader of the pack
