So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot then we can die
I know I wonâ€™t be leaving here with you
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "You don't show"
Don't move time is slow
I say, "Take me out"
Well I say, "You don't know"
You say, "You don't go"
I say, "Take me out"
If I move this could die
And eyes move this could die
I want you to, to take me out
I know I won't be leaving here
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
Well I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
If I wane this could die
I wait this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move this could die
Eyes move this can die
Come on, take me out
I know I won't be leaving here
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
