Come here sister, papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip about that new breed babe
He ain't no drag, papa's got a brand new bag
Come here mama and dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy but his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag, papa's got a brand new bag
He's doing the jerk, he's doing the fly
Don't play him cheap 'cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing the monkey, the mashed potatoes
Jump back Jack, see you later alligator
Come here sister, papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now but I can dig that new breed babe
He ain't no drag, he's got a brand new bag
Oh papa, he's doing the jerk
Papa he's doing the jerk
He's doing the twist just like this
He's doing the fly ev'ry day and ev'ry night
The thing's like the boomerang
Hey come on, hey, hey come on
Hey, search him before you find he's out of sight
Come on, see what he knows
Come on, see what he knows
