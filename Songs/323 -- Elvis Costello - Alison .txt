Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl
And with the way you look I understand
That you were not impressed but I heard
You let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress
I'm not gonna to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you are loving
Somebody, I only know it isn't mine
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true
Well I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake? You used to hold him
Right in your hand, I bet he took all he could take
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true, my aim is true
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true, my aim is true
