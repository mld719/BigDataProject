I sho'nuff feel good
I feel good like I knew that I wouldn't
I feel good, baby like I knew that I wouldn't
So good
I, I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice
I, I feel good like I said that I wouldn't
Lord help us, good God get down
So good, I get down
When I hold you in my arms
I know I can do no wrong
When I hold you in my arms
I know I can do no wrong
When I hold, baby in my arms
I know I can do no wrong
My love won't do you no harm
Hit me, make me feel good
Hit me, baby, hit me love
Like I knew that I wouldn't, so good
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice
Hit me, I feel good
Like I knew that I wouldn't
Hit me, so good
