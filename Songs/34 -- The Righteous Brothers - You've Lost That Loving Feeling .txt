You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it baby but baby, baby I know it
You've lost that loving feeling, oh that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone
Now there's no tenderness in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying baby 'cause baby
Something beautiful's dying
You've lost that loving feeling, oh that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, no oh oh
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Bring back that loving feeling, oh that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, no oh oh
