Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town
I should have known it from the very start
This girl will leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue, yeah
I might miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
Yeah, keep away from this girl
I know, know what she'll do
Keep away from Sue
She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
A-she goes out with other guys
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue, yeah
Stay away from that girl
Don't you know what to do now
Keep away from that girl
Don't you know what to do now
