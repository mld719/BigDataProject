Now there's a backseat lover
That's always under cover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on her muffin"
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheer leader
That's a real big pleaser
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing love it
Was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this
She starts swingin'
With the boys in tune
And her feet just fly up in the air
Singin' hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
And they swingin' like it just don't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Well like this
Like this
School girl sleazy
With a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hangin' way up her knee
It was three young ladies
In the school gym locker
And they find they were lookin' D
I was high school loser
Never made it with a lady
'Til a boy told me somethin' I missed
That my next door neighbor
Had a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl just a little kiss, like this
She starts swingin' with the boys in the school
With her feet flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a miss who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a hand
No no no no no no no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Well like this
