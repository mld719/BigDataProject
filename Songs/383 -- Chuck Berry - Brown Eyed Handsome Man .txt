Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
She said, free that brown eyed man
If you want your job you better free that brown eyed man
Flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
In fact every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women sheddin' tears
For a brown eyed handsome man
It's a lot of trouble with the brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her darlin' go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy, he's a brown eyed handsome man
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two, three, the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game, it was a brown eyed handsome man
