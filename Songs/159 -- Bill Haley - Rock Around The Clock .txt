One, Two, Three O'clock, Four O'clock rock,
Five, Six, Seven O'clock, Eight O'clock rock.
Nine, Ten, Eleven O'clock, Twelve O'clock rock,
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
Put your glad rags on and join me hon',
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one.
CHORUS:
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight,
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
When the clock strikes two, three and four,
If the band slows down we'll yell for more.
CHORUS:
When the chimes ring five, six, and seven,
We'll be right in seventh heaven.
CHORUS:
When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too,
I'll be goin' strong and so will you.
CHORUS:
When the clock stikes twelve we'll cool off then,
Start rockin' 'round the clock again.
CHORUS:
