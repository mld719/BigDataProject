Midnight finds me cryin'
Day time finds me cryin' too
I've got to get out of town
This whole city just brings me down, yeah
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
I made a promise to you such a long time ago
Now baby, now baby, now baby, now baby
It's time to make it come true yeah, come through yeah
Come true yeah, come through yeah, come true yeah
In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refuse to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in me trying, no
Little girl you're so young and you're so pretty
And one thing I know is true
Your going to be dead before your time is due
See my daddy in bed dying
Watched his hair been turning gray
I know he's been working and slaving
Working and slaving, slaving and working
Working, yeah
Work, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place, there's a better life
Don't you know, don't you know
Man, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
Well, well, well
Time brings about a change
Time on the clock, on the wall
Brings about a change, yeah
All of his life he's been slaving
All of the life he's been working
For what? For what?
For what? For what?
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up, yeah
See my daddy in bed dying
Watched his hair been turning gray
I know he's been working and slaving
And slaving and working, and working and slaving
Working, yeah
Work, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
There's a better life
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
Take me, take me, take me
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We just gotta get out of this place
There's a better life, there's a better world
There's a better way
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
There's a better world
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
I want to get you out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
Yeah, yeah, yeah
