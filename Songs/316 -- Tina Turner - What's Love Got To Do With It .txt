You must understand how the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Huh
I've been takin' on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinkin' about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Ho oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?)
Got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?)
Got to do
Huh, got to do with it
(What's love but a second hand emotion?)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
What's love?
(Ooh, ooh)
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?
(But a second hand emotion?)
