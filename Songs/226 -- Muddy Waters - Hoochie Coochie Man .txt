The gypsy woman told my mother
Before I was born
You got a boy child's comin'
He's gonna be a son of a gun
He gonna make pretty women
Jump and shout
Then the world wanna know
What this all about?
But you know I'm him
Everybody knows I'm him
Well you know I'm the, Hoochie Coochie Man
Everybody knows I'm him
I got a black cat bone
I got a mojo too
I got the Johnny Conkeroo
I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls
Lead me by my hand
Then the world will know
That I'm a Hoochie Coochie Man
But you know I'm him
Everybody knows I'm him
Well you know I'm the Hoochie Coochie Man
Everybody knows I'm him
On the seventh hours
On the seventh day
On the seventh month
The seven doctors say
You was born for good luck
And that you'll see
I got seven hundred dollars
And don't you mess with me
But you know I'm him
Everybody knows I'm him
Well you know we're the Hoochie Coochie boy
The whole round world knows we here
