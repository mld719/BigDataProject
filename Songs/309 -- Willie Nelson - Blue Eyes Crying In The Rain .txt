In twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in rain
