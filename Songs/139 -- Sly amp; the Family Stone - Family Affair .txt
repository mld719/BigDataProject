It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn yeah
Another child grows up to be
Somebody we just love to burn
Mom loves the both of them
You see it's in the blood, you see it's in the blood
Both kids are good to Mom
Blood's thicker than the mud, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
I'm that newlywed just a year ago
But they're still checking each other out
And nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out
You can't leave 'cause your heart is there
Sure you can't stay 'cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry 'cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway 'cause you're all broke down
It's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
It's a family affair, it's a family affair
