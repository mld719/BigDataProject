Ev'rywhere I hear the sound
Of marching charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy
Well, what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
I said hey and the time is right
For a palace revolution
But where I live the game
To play is compromise solution
Well, then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's no place for a street fighting man, no
I said, “Hey and my name
Is called Disturbance”
I'll shout and scream
I'll kill the king, I'll rail all his servants
Well, what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man, I know, no
