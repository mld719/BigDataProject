Pack up, I’m straight, enough
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Made off, don’t stray
Well, my kind’s your kind
I’ll stay the same
Pack up, don’t stray
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they don’t love you like I love you
