I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of the nothing in particular
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and the heir
Of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club
If you'd like to go
You could meet somebody
Who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home
And you cry and you want to die
When you say it's gonna happen now
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See, I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
