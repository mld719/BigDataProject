Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
Well, I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen
And I don't know what I want
I'm eighteen
I just don't know what I want
I'm eighteen
I gotta get away
Well, I gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, yeah
Well, I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt
I'm eighteen
I get confused every day
I'm eighteen
I just don't know what to say
I'm eighteen
I gotta get away
Well, I gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, yeah
Yeah, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form from the ups and down
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Oh, I like it
Love it
Like it
Love it
Eighteen
Eighteen
I'm eighteen and I like it
