Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear
I can't tell you, baby, where I'll be in a year
Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go must a got up and went
Well, I got good news, she's a real good liar
Backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit gone died, I guess it did
