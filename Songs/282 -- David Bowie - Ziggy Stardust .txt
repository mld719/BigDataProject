Ohh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar, jammin' good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars, he played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan
So where were the Spiders?
While the fly tried to break our balls
Just a beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans, and should we crush his sweet hands?
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper Messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band
Ohh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
