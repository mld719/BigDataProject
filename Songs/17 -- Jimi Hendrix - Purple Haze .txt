Purple haze all in my brain
lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny and i don't know why
excuse me while i kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
don't know if I'm going up or down
am i happy or in misery?
whatever at is a girl put a spell on me
Purple haze all in my eyes
don't know if it's day or night
you've got me blowin', blowin' my mind
is it tomorrow or just the end of time
help me, help me
i don't know
cant go on like this
blow my mind
