Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old [Incomprehensible], where's MacHeath, babe?
And he keeps it out of sight
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red, oh, let it swing, yeah
On a sidewalk, blue Sunday mornin'

Some, someone's sneakin' 'round a corner
Tell me, could that someone be Old Mack the Knife?
There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know?

Yes, that cement is there strictly for the weight, dear
Five'll got to gift you ten Old Macky's back in town

After drawin' out all his hard earned cash
And now MacHeath will spend just like a sailor
Could it be our boy done somethin' rash?

Sit back Miss Lotte Lenya and wait Old Lucy Brown

Look out, Old Macky is back
