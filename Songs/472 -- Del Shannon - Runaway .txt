As I walk along, I wonder
Oh, what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on
I think of the things we've done together
Oh, while our hearts were young
I'm a-walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
A wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
Why, why why why why why she ran away
And I wonder, oh where she will stay, yay
My little runaway, a-run-run-run-run-runaway
I'm a-walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
A wishing you were here by me to end this misery
I wonder, I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
Why, why why why why why she ran away
And I wonder, oh where she will stay, yay
My little runaway, a-run-run-run-run-runaway
A-run-run-run-run-runaway, a-run-run-run-run-runaway
