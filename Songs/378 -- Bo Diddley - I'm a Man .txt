Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
You know baby
We can have a lot of fun
I'm a man
I spell M A N
Man
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hour's time
I'm a man
I spell M A N
Man
I goin' back down
To Kansas Stew
Bring back the second cousin
Little John the conqueroo
I'm a man
Spell M A N
Man
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist
I'm a man
I spell M A N
Man
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, aeh
