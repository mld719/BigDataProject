Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
And most of all, we at war wit ourselves
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
You know what the Midwest is?
Young &Restless
Where restless niggaz might snatch yo' necklace
And next these niggaz might jack yo' Lexus
Somebody tell these niggaz who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless
(Uhhh!)
Try to catch it
(Uhhh!)
It's kinda hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying, "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Ya'll eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My momma used to say, “Only Jesus can save us”
Well momma, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna to break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothing I can do now ta right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid ‘cause we ain't spoke in so long
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now ta right my wrongs
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid ‘cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus walk with me)
To the hustlas, killas, murderas, drug dealas, even tha strippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers as role models, we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathy Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I dream about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screamin' out
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
