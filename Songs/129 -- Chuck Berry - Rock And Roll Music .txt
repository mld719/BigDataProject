Just let me hear some of that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man avail a sax
I must admit the have a rockin' band
Man they were blowin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jockey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play the tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way to early for the Congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
