Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all of the fellas in the world she belongs to me
But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
Soon we'll be married and raise a family
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
Every night, on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die"
Ooh, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
Oh, I tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
She's never hard to find
Just my imagination
She's always on my mind
(Running away with me)
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
