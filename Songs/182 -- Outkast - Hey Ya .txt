One, two, three go
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really want to
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
'Cause we don't know how
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Till there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But seperate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes it, love exception
So why oh, why oh, why oh
Why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial?
When you know we're not happy here
(Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance)
Hey ya! Hey ya!

Hey ya! Hey ya!
