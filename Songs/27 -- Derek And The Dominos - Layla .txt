What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waitin' by your side?
You've been runnin' an' hidin' much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't you ease my worried mind
I tried to give you consolation
When your own man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned my whole world, upside down
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't you ease my worried mind
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don't say, we'll never find a way
An' tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't you ease my worried mind
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't you ease my worried mind
