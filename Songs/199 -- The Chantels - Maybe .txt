Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry everyday
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
Maybe, if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe, if I kissed your lips
I'd be at my command
Oh, maybe
I've prayed and prayed to the Lord
To send you back, my love
But instead you came to me
Only in my dreams
Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe baby)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe baby)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe baby)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe baby)
