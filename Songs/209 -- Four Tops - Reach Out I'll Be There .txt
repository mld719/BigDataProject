Now, if you feel that you can't go on
All your hope is gone
Life is filled with much confusion
Happiness is just an illusion
And your world is tumblin' down
Darling, reach out
Reach out
I'll be there to love and shelter you
I'll be there, I'll always see you through
Wait a minute girl
When you feel lost and about to give up
And your best just ain't good enough
And your world is growin' cold
And you keep driftin' up on your own
Take my hand baby
Darling, reach out
Reach out
I'll be there to love and shelter you
I'll be there, I'll always see you through
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
I'll be there, you can always depend on me
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're alone and afraid
Through your tears you look around
There is no peace of mind to be found
Take my hand baby
Darlin' reach out
Reach out
I'll be there to love and shelter you
I'll be there, I'll always see you through
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
I'll be there, you can always depend on me
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I'll be there, whenever you need me
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I'll be there, whenever you need me
