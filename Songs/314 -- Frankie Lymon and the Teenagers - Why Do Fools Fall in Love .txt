Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see, for that fool is me
Tell me why, tell my why?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)
Why does my heart skip this crazy beat?
For I know, it will reach defeat
Tell me why, tell me why?
Why do fools fall in love?
