If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says
'15 miles to the love shack', love shack, yeah, yeah
I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway
Lookin' for the love getaway, heading for the love getaway
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale
And we're headin' on down to the love shack
I got me a Chrysler, it seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money
The love shack is a little old place
Where we can get together
Love shack, baby
(A love shack, baby)
Love shack, baby, love shack
Love shack, baby, love shack
Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby, that's where it's at)
Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby, that's where it's at)
Sign says, 'Stay away fools'
'Cause love rules at the love shack
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the highway
The love shack is a little old place
Where we can get together
Love shack, baby
(Love shack baby)
Love shack, that's where it's at
Love shack, that's where it's at
Huggin' and a kissin', dancin' and a lovin'
Wearin' next to nothing, 'cause it's hot as an oven
The whole shack shimmies, yeah, the whole shack shimmies
The whole shack shimmies
When everybody's movin' around
And around and around and around
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin', baby
Folks linin' up outside just to get down
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin', baby
Funky little shack, funky little shack
Hop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale
And it's about to set sail
I got me a car, it seats about twenty
So come on and bring your jukebox money
Oh, love shack is a little old place
Where we can get together
Love shack, baby
(A love shack, baby)
Love shack, baby, love shack
Love shack, baby, love shack
Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby, that's where it's at)
Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby, that's where it's at)
Bang, bang, bang, on the door, baby
(Knock a little louder baby)
Bang bang bang,on the door, baby
(I can't hear you)
Bang bang bang, on the door, baby
(Knock a little louder sugar)
Bang bang bang, on the door, baby
(I can't hear you)
Bang, bang, bang, on the door, baby
(Knock a little louder )
Bang, bang, bang,on the door, baby
Bang, bang
(On the door, baby)
Bang, bang
(On the door)
Bang, bang
(On the door, baby)
Bang, bang, your what? Tin roof, rusted!

Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby that's where it's at, yeah)
Love shack, baby, love shack
(Love baby that's where it's at)
Love baby, love shack
(Huggin' and a kissin')
(Dancin' and a lovin' at the love shack)
