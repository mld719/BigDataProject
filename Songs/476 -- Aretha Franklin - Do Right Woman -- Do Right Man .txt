Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted leaving love unsure
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you wanna do right all days, woman
You've gotta be a do right all night, man
Yeah, yeah, they say that, "It's a man's world"
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me
If you wanna do right all days, woman
You've gotta be a do right all night, man
A woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you wanna do right all days, woman
You've gotta be a do right all night, man
You've gotta be a do right all night, man
