Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah
Like I please you
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, “love”?
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Come on
(Come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah
Like I please you
I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart
(In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you
It's so hard to reason with you
Whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?
