Well Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Speed jive don’t wanna stay alive when you’re twenty-five
And Wendy’s stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freedy’s got spots from ripping off the stars
From his face, funky little boat race
The television man is crazy saying we’re juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need TV when I got T-Rex
Oh brother you guessed, I’m a dude dad
All the young dudes
(Hey dudes!)
Carry the news
(Where are ya?)
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up, come on)
Carry the news
All the young dudes
(I wanna hear you)
Carry the news
(I wanna see you)
Boogaloo dudes
(And I wanna talk to you, all of you)
Carry the news
Now Lucy looking sweet 'cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it’s a real mean team
But we can love, oh yes we can love
And my brother’s back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that Revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags
Now I drunk a lot of wine and I’m feeling fine
Gotta race some cat to bed
Oh is there concrete all around or is it in my head?
Yeah, I’m a dude dad
All the young dudes
(Hey dudes!)
Carry the news
(Where are ya?)
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up)
Carry the news
All the young dudes
(I wanna hear ya)
Carry the news
(I wanna see you)
Boogaloo dudes
(And I wanna relate to you)
Carry the news
All the young dudes
(What dudes?)
Carry the news
(Let’s hear the news, come on)
Boogaloo dudes
(I wanna kick you)
Carry the news

All the young dudes

Boogaloo dudes

Carry the news
(Now you, all his friends)
All the young dudes
(Now you bring him down 'cause I want him)
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
(I want him right here, bring him, come on)
Carry the news
(Bring him, ha ha, here you go)
All the young dudes

Carry the news

Boogaloo dudes
(How do you feel?)
Carry the news
