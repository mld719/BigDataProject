God save the Queen
A fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential H-bomb
God save the Queen
She ain't no human being
There is no future
In England's dreaming
Don't be told about what you want
Don't be told about what you need
No future, no future, no future for you
God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves
God save the Queen
Tourists are money
But our figurehead
Is not what she seems
God save history
God save your mad parade
Oh Lord, have mercy!
All crimes are paid
When there's no future, how can there be sin?
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in the human machine
We're the future, we're the future
God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves
God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves
No future, no future
No future, no future
No future, no future
No future, no future
No future, no future
No future, no future
No future for you
