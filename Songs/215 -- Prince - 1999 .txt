{Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun}
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin', could've sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple, there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction, you know I didn't even care
Say say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonite I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, so sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonite
Yeah hey, they say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonite I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
Yeah, yeah, hey
People, let me tell you somethin'
If you didn't come to party, don't bother knockin' on my door, oww
I got a lion in my pocket and baby he's ready to roar, yeah hey
Everybody's got a bomb, we could all die any day, oh
But before I let that happen, I'll dance my life away, oh ho
They say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
(We're runnin' out of time)
So tonite I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
(We gonna, we gonna, oh)
Say it one more time
Two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
(No, no)
So tonite I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
(We gonna, we gonna)
Alright, nineteen ninety-nine
You say it, nineteen ninety-nine
Mmm nineteen ninety-nine
(Oww, nineteen ninety-nine)
Don't stop it, don't stop it, say it one more time
Two thousand zero zero party over, oops out of time
(Yeah, yeah)
So tonite I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
(We gonna, we gonna, whoa)
Yeah, nineteen ninety-nine
Don't you wanna go?

We could all die any day

I don't wanna die, I'd rather dance my life away
