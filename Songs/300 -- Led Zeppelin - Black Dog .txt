Hey hey mama said the way you move,
Gon' make you sweat, gon' make you groove.
Ah-ah child way you shake that thing,
Gon' make you burn, gon' make you sting.
Hey hey baby when you walk that way,
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ahh.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ahh.
I gotta roll, can't stand still,
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill.
Eyes that shine burning red,
Dreams of you all through my head.
Ah-ah
Ah-ahh ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ahhh
Hey baby, whoa baby, pretty baby
Darling give it to me now. (?)
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move the way you're doing now. (?)
Didn't take too long 'fore I found out,
What people mean by down and out.
Spent my money, took my car
Started telling her friends she gon' be a star.
I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ahh.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ahh.
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rolling woman gonna come my way.
Need a girl to hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies
Make me a happy man.
Ah-ah
Ah-ahh ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ahhhhh
