Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag
School's out for the summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looks
Well, we got no class
And we got no principals
We ain't got no intelligence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes
School's out for the summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's
Dirty looks
Out for summer
Out till fall
We might not come
Back at all
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
School's out completely
