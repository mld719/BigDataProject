I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can?
People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me
Hey baby, you didn't go for that it's a natural fact
That I wanna come back show me where it's at, baby
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
As soon as you can?
I guess you know that I, uh, I love you so
Even though you don't want me no more
Hey hey hey hey, and I'm cryin' tears all through the years
I'll tell ya like it is honey, love me if you will
Yeah baby
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby
Sometimes I wonder
If you love me like you say you do
You see baby, I I I I've been thinkin' about it, yeah
I've been, I've been wantin' to get next to you baby
Ya see, sometimes I hold my arms, I say, oh
Oh baby, meeting you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream, yeah
I'm so tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
So tired of being alone
