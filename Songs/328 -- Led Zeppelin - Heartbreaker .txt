Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town?
It won't take long, just watch and see
That the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Well, it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
Name, name, name, name, oh, name
Work so hard I can't unwind, get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker, heartbreak, heartbreak, heart
