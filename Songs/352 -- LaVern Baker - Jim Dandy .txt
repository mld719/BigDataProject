Jim Dandy on a mountain top
30,000 feet to drop

Jim Dandy met a girl named Sue
She was feeling kind of blue
Jim Dandy he's the kind of guy
Never liked to see a little girl cry

Jim Dandy had a submarine
Got a message from my mermaid queen
She was hanging from a fishing line
Jim Dandy didn't waste no time
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy wanted to go to Maine
Got a ticket on a DC plane

He was hip and ready to boot

Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go on, Jim Dand
Jim Dandy, go
