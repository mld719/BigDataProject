Yeah, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Lord, I'm gonna fade away
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, hey, yeah
Oh, see the fire is sweepin'
At our streets today
Burnin' like a red coal carpet
A mad bull lost its way
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, hey, yeah
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Yeah, a storm is threatening
My very life today
A gimme, a gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, shot away, shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, shot away, shot away
I tell love, sister, yeah, it's just a kiss away
I tell love, sister, yeah, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away, kiss away, kiss away
Gimme shelter, yeah, gimme shelter,yeah
Gimme shelter, yeah, gimme shelter
Gimme shelter, gimme shelter
