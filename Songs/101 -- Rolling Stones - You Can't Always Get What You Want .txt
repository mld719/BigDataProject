Well, I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would go meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
No, you can't always get what you want
No, you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime, you just might find
You get what you need
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair shares of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
And if we don't, we don't blow a 50-amp fuse", yeah
And no, you can't always get what you want
No, you can't always get what you want
Well, no, you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need, baby
And I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescriptions filled
I was standin' in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided to have a soda
"Whatcha favorite flavor?", "Cherry red"
And I sung my song to my friend Jimmy
And he said one word back to me, that was "Dead"
I said
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You get what you need
Oh, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
And I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
And she was practised that the art of deception
I could tell by her blood-stained hands
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
Oh, you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need
