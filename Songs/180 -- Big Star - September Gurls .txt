September gurls do so much
I was your butch and you were touched
I loved you well never mind
I've been crying all the time
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
September gurls I don't know why
How can I deny what's inside
Even though I'll keep away
Maybe we'll love all our days
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
When I get to bed
Late at night
That's the time
She makes things right
When she makes love to me
September gurls do so much
I was your butch and you were touched
I loved you well never mind
I've been crying all the time
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
