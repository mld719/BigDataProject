Hey, get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Preacher man, don't tell me, Heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know, what life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold, half the story has never been told
And now you see the light, you stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up a fight
You see, most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything and make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth, you would look for yours on earth
Now you see the light, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up a fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up a fight
Sick and tired of a the ism-skism game
Dyin' n' goin' to Heaven in a Jesus name, Lord
We know when we understand, Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you couldn't fool all the people all the time
And now you see the light, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight, no
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight
Don't give up the fight, don't give up a fight
I say now, don't give up the fight
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
I say now
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
So we won't give up the fight, so we won't give up the fight
You see, most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything, make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth, you would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right, stand up for your right
Stand up for your right
