I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my lovin' won't fade away
Oh but you know my lovin' won't fade away
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you, you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
A love for real, not fade away
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
A love to last more than one day
A love that's love and not fade away
A love that's love and not fade away
