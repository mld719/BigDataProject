In France, a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance, his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen year old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples'
High on crack, toting a machine gun
Time, times
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is telling you somebody died
A sister killed her baby
'Cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer
For the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times, times
It's silly no, when a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly?
But some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies, oh, why?
Time, time
Baby, make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn?
Time, time
Is it silly no, when a rocket blows
And everybody still wants to fly?
Some say that man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why, oh, why? Sign 'o' the times
Time, time
Sign 'o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate if it's a boy
Time, time
