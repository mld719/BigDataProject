I want him and I need him
And someday, someway
I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy
But real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain he's my guy
By the things he'll like to do
Like walking in the rain
And wishing on the stars up above
And being so in love
When he's near me, I'll kiss him
And when he leaves me
I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight
But I won't really care
And I'll know it's gonna be alright
'Cause we've got so much we share
Like walking in the rain
And wishing on the stars up above
And being so in love
Johnny
No, no he'll never do
Bobby
No it isn't him too
They would never
No they'd never, never, ever love
Walking in the rain
And wishing on the stars up above
And being so in love
Oh oh, where can he be? Oh oh
I've been wishing and hoping
Where can he be?
