He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
With the secrets of the worlds
His subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry Gods to see
The women all were beautiful
Men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So others could go on
Hate was just a legend
War was never known
People worked together
And they lifted many stones
They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today
And I know she's living there
She loves me to this day
I still can't remember how
Or where I lost my way
He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer
Yeah dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer, killer
He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer
