Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself, where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country and you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven and the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset when the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost these empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry for our nation's golden child
And even though we try the truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express the joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle
In the wind never fading with the sunset when the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned our long before your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose may you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose from a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion more than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset when the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before your legend ever will
