There was a guy
An under water guy who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge
From New York and New Jersey
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole
Now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold
Everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns, I'll get mine too
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
Rock me Joseph, Alberto, Santiago
If Man is 5, if Man is 5, if Man is 5
Then the Devil is 6, then the Devil is 6
The Devil is 6, the Devil is 6 and if the Devil is 6
Then God is 7, then God is 7
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
