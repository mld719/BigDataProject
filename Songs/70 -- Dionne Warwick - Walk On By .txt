If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private 'cause each time I see
I break down and cry, I cry
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by
I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem, broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye, you said good bye
So walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye, you said goodbye
So walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry
You better walk on by
Walk on by
Oh, walk on by, don't stop
Oh, walk on by, don't stop
Oh, walk on by, don't stop
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry
