I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead
Just need to find a place where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand and, "No", was all he said
Take a load off Anny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Anny
And you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)
I picked up my bag and I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
And I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, would you go downtown"
And she said, "Well, I gotta go but my friend can stick around"
And take a load off Anny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Anny
And you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)
Go down, Miss Moses, there ain't nothin' that you can say
'Cause just ol' Luke and Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
"Well, now Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Anny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Anny
And you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rags, if you'll take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"
Take a load off Anny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Anny
And you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)
Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line
My, my bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Anny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
Take a load off Anny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Anny
And you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)
