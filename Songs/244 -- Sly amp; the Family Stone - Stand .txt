Stand, in the end, you'll still be you
One that's done all the things you set out to do
Stand, there's a cross for you to bear
Things to go through if you're goin' anywhere
Stand for the things you know are right
It's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight
Stand, all the things you want are real
You have you to complete and there is no deal
Stand, stand, stand
(Everybody, yeah)
Stand, stand, stand
Stand, you've been sitting much too long
There's a permanent crease in your right and wrong
Stand, there's a midget standing tall
And a giant beside him about to fall
Stand, stand, stand
Stand, stand, stand
Stand, they will try to make you crawl
And they know what you're sayin' makes sense at all
Stand, don't you know that you are free
Well, at least in your mind if you want to be
Everybody
Stand, stand
Stand
Na na na na na na na na na na
Stand
Na na na na na na na na na na
Stand
Na na na na na na na na na na
Stand
Na na na na na na na na na na
Stand
Na na na na na na na na na na
