Shooby doo wop wop wop
Shooby doo wop wop wop
Shooby doo wop wop wop
My heart is fine, fine, lonely teardrops
Why they'll never dry up? Lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will, say you will
Say you will, say you will
Hey hey, say you will
My heart is fine, fine, lonely teardrops
Why they'll never dry up? Lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will, say you will
Say you will, say you will
Hey hey, say you will
Just give me another chance, for I'll romance
Come on and tell me that one day you'll return
'Cause everyday that you've been gone away
You'll know why my heart does nothing but burn crying
Lonely teardrops
Why they'll never dry up? Lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will, say you will
Say you will, say you will
Hey hey, say you will
Say it right now baby, say you will
Come on, come on, say you will
Say it darling yeah, say you will
