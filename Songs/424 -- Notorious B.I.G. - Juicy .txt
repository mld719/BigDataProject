Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter
To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's all good baby, baby, check it
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' ***s and stuff
Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
Damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
(And if you don't know, now you know, you know)
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
(And if you don't know, now you know)
Representin' B-Town in the house
(Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, Mad Flavor, uh, uh
(Bad Boy, I see you Gooch, yeah)
Aight, yeah
(Junior Mafia)
You know very well who you are
(Puff Daddy)
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
(It's all good, Brooklyn)
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
(The Bronx, Queens, Uptown, Mt. Vernon)
(South Central, Detroit, East Side, West Side, it's all good)
