The reason why, oh I can say
I have to let you go, babe and run away
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Baby for a long time, you had me believe
Oh that your love was all mine and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone, up when you're gone
Now I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not going to play your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone, up when you're gone
Up when you're gone
Up when you're gone
