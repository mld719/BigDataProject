They said, "Release remote control"
But we didn't want it on the label
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"
And people laughed and the press went mad
Oh, someone's really smart
Oh, complete control, that's a laugh
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
At every hotel we was met by the law
Come for the party, come to make sure
Oh, have we done something wrong?
Oh, complete control, even over this song
They said, "We'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper"
They meant let's make a lotsa money
An' worry about it later
Oh, I'll never understand
Oh, complete control, lemme see your other hand
I don't trust you
Why should you trust me?
All over the news spread fast
They're dirty, they're filthy
They ain't gonna last
