I'm waiting for my man
Got twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man
Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just waiting for a dear, dear friend of mine
Waiting for my man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
Hey baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
You know that I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just some more time
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man
Alright, I'm waiting for my man
Alright, I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man, oh you got it
I'm waiting for my man, you know
I'm waiting for my man, please baby
